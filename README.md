Two players are moving around. We can have barriers spawned randomly across the map. They can shoot balls at each other.
Weâ€™ll want collision between the players and balls such that players lose points as or health as they get hit. Then, the game ends when the first player gets down to 0 points.
Collision between the balls and barriers should destroy the balls.
There should be no collision between players and barriers.
